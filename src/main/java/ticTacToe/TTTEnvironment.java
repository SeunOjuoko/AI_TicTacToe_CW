/**
 * This is a Reinforcement Learning environment for TicTacToe, to be used in conjunction with Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. Like everywhere else, 
 * the opponent here is modeled as part of the environment, is by default a {@link RandomAgent} and is always assigned as the 'O' agent;
 * whereas the RL agent (e.g. {@link QLearningAgent}) interacting with this environment always plays as 'X'. The key method to be used from this class
 * is the {@link TTTEnvironment#executeMove} method which takes a move (from X) and returns an {@link Outcome} object containing reward received as well
 * as the target state.
